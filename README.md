# YouTube Subs as Home

This small extension for Safari fixes an annoyance in the late 2012
vintage of YouTube whereby going to the [YouTube][1] home page takes you to
YouTube's amalgam of your subscriptions and YouTube's recommendations,
called [What to Watch][2].

More specifically, it changes following:

* Clicking the YouTube logo will take you to 
[your subscriptions feed][3].
* Clicking What to Watch in the guide menu will take you directly to the
[highlights feed][2] instead of the home page.
* If you navigate to *www.youtube.com* or *youtube.com* directly, you
will automatically be redirected to your subscriptions feed.
